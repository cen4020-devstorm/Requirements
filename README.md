# Software Requirements Specifications
## Purpose Statement  

This **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **SAFE Team Web Application** at **USF**. It serves as a reference for the **DevStorm development team**, project stakeholders, and future maintainers. The document ensures the system meets user needs and integrates effectively with existing campus operations.  

## Overview  

This SRS outlines the **SAFE Team system’s objectives, features, and requirements**. It includes:  
- **Introduction** – Background, purpose, and objectives.  
- **System Features** – Real-time tracking, notifications, and ride management.  
- **Product Requirements** – Functional and non-functional specifications.  
- **System Design Considerations** – Technical choices and scalability.  

This structure provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the system.  

## Product Perspective  

The SAFE Team web app **modernizes USF’s existing phone-based ride request system** by introducing **real-time tracking, wait time estimates, and notifications**. It operates independently but aligns with **USF’s campus safety and transportation services**. While it has no direct software dependencies, it may integrate **Google Maps API** for location tracking, improving service efficiency and user experience.
